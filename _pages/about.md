I'm a MSc Data Science student and fellow NLP researcher at the <a href="https://inside.disco.unimib.it/">Insid&s Lab</a> at the University of Milano Bicocca, working on saefty and interpretability of LLMs.

From Jan to Mar 24', I've been a VSR at Stanford under the supervision of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> and <a href="https://federicobianchi.io">Federico Bianchi</a> working on mechanistic interpretability for AI Safety. Recently, I'm collaborating with LSE AI Lab on improving Sparse Autoencoders.

I'm also a volunteer ML specialist at <a href="https://thegoodscientists.com/">The Good Scientists</a>.
